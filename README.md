# SALES ANALYSIS FOR BEVERAGE MANUFACTURING COMPANY 

Created a concise, quick, one-page interactive dashboard to analyze the sale of beverages based on Category, Class and Province spanning a year.  In this project, I have leveraged the power of data analysis and visualization techniques to provide a comprehensive understanding of the company's wine and spirits sales trends and patterns.

## PROJECT PROPOSAL 
1. EWS, a beverage manufacturing company is distributing wines and spirits to the majority areas of Canada, the United States (Nevada), a few parts of South America, South Africa, and Australia.
2. Demonstrated a geographical representation of products being distributed throughout the vendors across the world.
3. Identified the top 5 global sales and represented them in a line graph based on Class, Category and Province that helps EWS choose products to sell to the retailers who would generate high sales in future. 
4. Scrutinized and detached the Product’s unique number from the Product name (For ex. Separated 699860 from Unauthorized Supplier - 12x1000) into an individual column to link the product’s unique no. with the same in other Excel documents to distinguish for easier access, analysis, and forecasting.
5. Classified the Class, Categories, and Unique Product number based on period with a horizontal bar chart and numbers for achieving clarity, transparency, and ease of understanding.
6. Highlighted the selling rate in different colours (0-33%-> Red, 34%-66%->Yellow, 67%-100%-> Green).
7. Recognized that most of the products have ‘0’ as their Product number, which might cause duplication and complexity and, therefore can give an incorrect prediction 
8. There are around 2628069 Categories without Class (Parent). For ex. Cider, 7% Sparkling, Alcohol, Mead, Ice Wine, and Domestic Beer do not fall under any Class 
9. Created Slicers with a drop-down to filter products based on Class, Category and Province for ease of access.
